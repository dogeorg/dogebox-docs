Dogebox requires the following hardware specs to run:

- UEFI Support
- `>1GB` RAM
- `>50GB` Disk Space (`>300` if you want to sync the blockchain)

It is possible to install Dogebox to one hard drive and use another as your "storage" device. This is configured during initial setup.

1. Download the ISO image for your machine architecture from the [Dogebox releases page](https://github.com/dogeorg/dogebox/releases)
2. Write the ISO to a USB drive
3. Boot from the USB drive and proceed with installation, following [instructions here](./setup.md)
