## What is the Dogebox project?

Dogebox is a Linux server distribution and collection of custom software built specifically to meet the needs of the Dogecoin community. 

The objective: to provide a decentralised platform for the development, distribution and self-hosting of software (we call them PUPs) that will bring real utility to the Dogecoin ecosystem and drive adoption.

Through this we envisage a system of inter-connected, open-source solutions that build on each other to help shift Dogecoin from ‘speculative asset’ to ‘useful means of exchange for all humanity’.

## Levelling up Dogecoin development

A major barrier to adoption has been the technical knowledge required to safely integrate Dogecoin into existing systems. Our aim is to close the gap between ‘hardcore crypto hackers‘ and everyday devs building solutions on Dogecoin. 


By making a secure, deterministic platform, built on Linux, we aim to make self-hosting these services as easy as possible for everyday Dogecoin enjoyers, while also providing robust solutions for serious businesses integrating Dogecoin into their products.

A built-in decentralised marketplace of Dogecoin Services (PUPs) which can be one-click installed and configured, gives the whole community a place to experiment with new ideas and share them around a network of Shibes interconnected across the globe.


## Democratising Dogecoin

The importance of decentralised decision making, or ‘voting-with-your-feet’, is critical to the health of the Dogecoin network. As a decentralised network with contributions from many groups and individual developers, the Dogecoin blockchain lives and dies by network consensus. 

Dogebox aims to put that ability to vote into the hands of every Dogecoin user, making it easy to switch between implementations of various features, from network, to key management, to indexing and many more, without disturbing the services layered on top. 

This design decision means the Dogecoin community can try out new features and decide themselves what works best for Dogecoin, without having to ‘rebuild the universe’ on top every time, nor be beholden to a technical elite group of developers who control what people run on their node. 

Dogecoin is not Dogecoin unless we ALL have the power to determine its future.
