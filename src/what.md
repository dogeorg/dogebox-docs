## What is the Dogebox project?

Dogebox is a Linux server distribution and custom server software built
specifically to meet the needs of the Dogecoin community.

The objective: to provide a decentralised platform for the development, 
distribution and self-hosting of software (we call them PUPs) that will 
bring real utility to the Dogecoin ecosystem and drive adoption.
